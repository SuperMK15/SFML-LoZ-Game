# SFML-LoZ-Game
This is a Legend of Zelda spinoff game that I created using the SFML library as a grade 12 computer science project. The game uses object oriented programming.

The images and audio folders contain the files used to create the visuals and sounds for the game, while the .h and .cpp files contain the headers and source code for all of my classes. The header files are the class specification files, while the .cpp files are the class implementation files. The main.cpp is the file that runs the game itself.
